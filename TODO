* You are not required to subscribe in order to get configurations
  such as "fullfeed".
* Clear "buffers" and "clients"
* Normalize all heap keys (constants?)
* Test in tests incorrect input for all registrations (regexp, for example)
* Test in code more registrations (where args are available, like in regexp)
* "quit" method should delete all client data
* The handle doesn't seem to get cleaned up ($self->clients->{$HANDLE}{})
* Because tests are using 'done_testing' and there's no count, it's impossible to know if a line did or did not arrive
