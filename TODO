* Clear "buffers" and "clients"
* Normalize all heap keys (constants?)
* Test in tests incorrect input for all registrations (regexp, for example)
* Test in code more registrations (where args are available, like in regexp)
* "quit" method should delete all client data
* The handle doesn't seem to get cleaned up ($self->clients->{$HANDLE}{})
* Because tests are using 'done_testing' and there's no count, it's impossible to know if a line did or did not arrive
* Support for filter types? "Stream" is a no-op, "Line" is... the default?
* Move all timers to $self->{'_timers'}
* Check for memory leaks caused by closing over $self in callbacks saved in hash keys in $self
* Rewrite on_read in Eris client
* All regexes matches are created one a time, but you can only unregister from all
* When unregistering streams, why not just keep it empty? delete entire slot is silly

bin/eris-server.pl:
    * Add Getopt::Long
