Fix:
    * Rewrite on_read in Eris client

Code cleanup:
    * Normalize all heap keys (constants?)
    * Clear "buffers" and "clients"
    * "quit" method should delete all client data
    * When unregistering streams, why not just keep it empty? delete entire slot is silly

Feature:
    * Support for filter types? "Stream" is a no-op, "Line" is... the default?

Tests:
    * Test in tests incorrect input for all registrations (regexp, for example)
    * Test in code more registrations (where args are available, like in regexp)
    * Because tests are using 'done_testing' and there's no count, it's impossible to know if a line did or did not arrive

bin/eris-server.pl:
    * Add Getopt::Long
